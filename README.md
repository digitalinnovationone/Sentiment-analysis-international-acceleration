# Artificial Intelligence to Detect Emotions 🤖📈

## Project Description

In this project, we propose the implementation of an artificial intelligence (AI) capable of detecting and classifying emotions expressed in texts. Based on machine learning techniques, we will explore how this approach can improve understanding of customers' needs and feelings, contributing to the offering of personalized services and enhancing operational efficiency in various sectors, especially in the context of financial services.

## Repository Organization 📁

The repository is structured as follows:

- **Base Project**: Contains initial notebooks for implementation.
- **Final Project**: This folder contains the finalized projects.

## Acceleration Details 🚀

During the international acceleration, two different approaches for emotion detection will be explored:
